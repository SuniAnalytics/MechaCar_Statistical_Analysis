# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview

   Goal of the project is to assist AutoRus's project by providing statistical driven insights for newest prototype - The MechaCar. As the program is facing production troubles, management needs support from data analytics team to identify areas that can help and imrove manufacturing team's progress. 
   
   Will utilize my learnings from R and statistic models to analyse and provide insights. 
     
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to mpg

### Slope of the linear model
      The p-Value for this model, p-Value: 5.35e-11, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indcates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

### Does this model predict mpg effectively
      This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Relatively speaking, his multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
